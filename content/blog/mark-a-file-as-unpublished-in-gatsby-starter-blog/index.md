The first thing I wanted to do after setting up this new blog using the Gatsby Starter Project is to make it possible to only display posts that I wanted to show. There are for sure going to be times where I want to work on a series of posts over time that I can also version, but not have them show on my live site until I am ready. This is where I first started learning about frontmatter and how to query it using GraphQL in the Gatsby blog.

NOTE: This probably won't scale well
