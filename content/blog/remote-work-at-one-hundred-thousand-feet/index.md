In all honesty, this is really just a placeholder/coming soon post. Having worked remotely both as a full-time employee, and as an independent contractor I have my own personal experiences and opinions on remote work. Having friends, and aquantences who also work remotely I have at hand their experiences to draw from. And, there have been many books and blog posts, sheets and sheets, discussing the benefits and the challenges of a remote work environment. So stick around more to come!

If you want to start on your own research I can tell you that much of what the crews at [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) and [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) have been doing for years are a big inspiration to me. They will be featured in the future here on the site.
